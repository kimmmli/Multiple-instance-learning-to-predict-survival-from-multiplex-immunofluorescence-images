The big goal of this project intends to explore the association between NSCLC biomarkers and patient outcomes, which is approached by two sub-goals. 
1️⃣ The first sub-goal is developing some different machine learning models to see whether machine learning algorithms can help to predict patients’ 2 years survival (0 or 1). 
2️⃣ The second sub-goal is checking whether adding spatial information, which describes where the embedding is in the original medical images, to the input of machine learning models could help improve models’ performance. 
Please refer to final.pdf and/or final.qmd to see experiments, results and corresponding codes.
