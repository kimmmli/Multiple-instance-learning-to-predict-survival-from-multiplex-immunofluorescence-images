🎯 The big goal of this project intends to explore the association between NSCLC biomarkers and patient outcomes, which is approached by two sub-goals. 
1️⃣ The first sub-goal is developing some different machine learning models to see whether machine learning algorithms can help to predict patients’ 2 years survival (0 or 1). 
2️⃣ The second sub-goal is checking whether adding spatial information, which describes where the embedding is in the original medical images, to the input of machine learning models could help improve models’ performance. 
👀 Please refer to final.pdf and/or final.qmd to see detailed experiments, results and corresponding codes.
📚 The data is private for now and will be published soon!
