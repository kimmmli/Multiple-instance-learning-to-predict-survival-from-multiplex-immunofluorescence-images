The big goal of this project intends to explore the association between NSCLC biomarkers and patient outcomes. The big goal is approached by two sub-goals. The first sub-goal is developing some different machine learning models to see whether machine learning algorithms can help to predict patients’ 2 years survival (0 or 1). The second sub-goal is checking whether adding spatial information, which describes where the embedding is in the original medical images, to the input of machine learning models could help improve models’ performance, which consequently contributes to predict patients’ survival. Please refer to final.pdf to see experiments, results and corresponding codes.
